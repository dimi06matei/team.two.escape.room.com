                <h3>Themes</h3>
                <p> We had to create a game about The First Mitropoly of Wallachia and Baiazid the First.</p>
            </div>
             <div class="course-col">
                <h3>The descreption of the game</h3>
                <p> Our team made a 3D, single player escape room. The game has two levels. In the first one, you will  navigate through the first Mitropoly of Wallachia and find information about it. You will have to remember the information because you will need it for later. To unlock the door to the second level you will have to find a key that is hidden in the room. In the second level, you will walk through the dungeons of The first Mitropoly of Wallachia where Baizid Ist imprisoned you. You will have to find the keys to different doors to enter the last challenge. In order to escape, you will have a knowledge battle with Baiazid.</p>

                <h3> Softwares we used</h3>
                <p> To create the escape room we chose to use the game engine Unity. Unity is a cross-platform game engine developed by Unity Technologies, which is primarily used to develop video games and simulations for computers, consoles and mobile devices. For this website we used html and css.</p>

      <h1>The First Mitropoly of Wallachia</h1>
      <p> A resume abou it</p>
      <div class="row">
          <div class="campus-col"><h3>Facts about the mitropoly</h3><p>Ungrovlahia's mitropoly was a canonical structure of Orthodoxy, established in 1359 by the Patriarchate of Constantinople. In that year, the ecumenical patriarch Calistus Ist appointed the Greek monk Iachint of Vicina as the first holder of the Mitropoly of Ungrovlahia.<br> The name of the mitropoly comes from the need to distinguish at that time the Wallachians in the Balkans (territories inhabited by Wallachians) from the one under the authority of the Kingdom of Hungary, called for this reason Ungrovlahia.<br>Initially, the mitropoly's headquarters were in Câmpulung, then in Curtea de Argeș. In 1517 the metropolitan seat was moved to Târgoviște, and in 1668 to Bucharest. Until 1990, the Metropolitan of Ungrovlahia was the Archbishop of Bucharest, who from 1925 also served as Patriarch of the Romanian Orthodox Church.
	<br>In 1990,  the centuries-old name of the Mitropoly of Ungrovlahia was replaced with that of the Mitropoly of Muntenia and Dobrogea. 
 
</p>
          </div>
          <div class="campus-col"><h3>Establishment of the Mitropoly of Wallachia</h3><p>On May 1, 1359, the Patriarchate of Constantinople recognized the Mitropoly of Wallachia, based at  Curtea de Arges.
	<br>A certain ecclesiastical hierarchy existed even before the founding of the medieval Wallahian states, but a hierarchy recognized by the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople, the supreme authority within Orthodoxy, appeared only during the reign of Nicholas Alexander (1352-1364). Beyond the religious plan, the event marks independence from neighboring Catholic states.
	<br>The moments of recognition of the mitropoly of Ungrovlahia is not identical with the beginnings of the organization of church life in Wallahia, which must be sought much earlier, because there could be no Orthodox countries without hierarchs.
	<br>The principalities and voivodeships, which preceded the founding of the Wallahian feudal states, had in addition to princes or voivodes, also hierarchs, in their scheme of functions.<br>After the voivode of Wallahia Basarab Ist the Founder had managed to unify the country, he also gained independence from the Hungarian crown after the famous battle of Posada (1330), where he defeated the Hungarian king Carol Robert de Anjou.<br>However, the recognition of the Metropolitan Church of Ungrovlahia is linked to the name of his son, Nicolae Alexandru (1352-1364). He summoned to his court the Metropolitan Iachint of Vicina, a city at the mouth of the Danube, where there was already an Orthodox mitropoly listening to Constantinople.<br>Nicolae Alexandru Basarab (1352-1364) was the first ruler to mint his own currency, which proves that his voivodeship experienced a period of economic flourishing. He also needed external recognition, because the recognition of the Metropolitan and the Mitropoly of his voivodeship was implicitly a recognition of the state. It is necessary to specify the fact that Wallachia stretched, since the time of Basarab I, over both banks of the maritime Danube and over Dobrogea.

              </p></div>
              <div class="campus-col"><h3>Conclusions</h3>
     <p>Even if we do not know any hierarch from Muntenia or in Muntenia, until 1359, when Iachint is documented, the fact that the Mitropoly of Vicina, probably founded in the 11th century, located in Dobrogea, near Isaccea, was still part of the country's body since 1321 or 1337, proves that Basarab and his son Nicoae Alexandru, already had an Orthodox hierarch within the borders of their voivodeship.<br>Iachint is documented, for the first time, as Metropolitan of Vicina, in 1348 and it is not excluded that, once ascended the throne, Nicolae Alexandru Basarab brought him to Câmpulung or Argeş, after which he tried to legislate this transfer. In this sense, the patriarchal act, which marks the transfer of Iachint, from Vicina to Argeş, must be seen only as a recognition of an existing state and not of the creation of a new institution, as it has long been considered by some historians. <br>The synodal decision of May 1359, in which historians saw the founding of the Metropolitan Church of Ungrovlahia, is therefore nothing more than the acceptance and recognition by the Ecumenical Patriarchate of a de facto existing reality.<br>
         It is important to emphasize that the decision of the Ecumenical  Patriarchate Synod of May 1359 does not create a new situation, as in the case of the newly converted people to Christianity, but is a reorganization within the same Orthodox Church, present for centuries in this territory. It only approves the relocation of Metropolitan Iachint "to the seat of all Ungrovlahia," urging the Church's servants to "submit to him."</p></div>

        <p>   A resume about his life</p>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="facilities-col">
                <h3>Facts about him</h3>
                
              
                <p> Baiazid, also known as Beyazit or Bajazet  was the  Sultan of the Ottoman Empire from 1389 to 1402. The son of Murad I and Gülçiçek "Fior di Rosa" Khatun, ascended the throne after his father's death in the first battle of Kosovo Polje and as soon as he was crowned he strangled his younger brother Yakub to prevent him from organizing a coup of the state.<br>The nickname Ilderim (Lightning) was given to Baiazid because of the speed of his decisions and his military movements, as well as the courage and speed with which he moved his troops.

                <h3>Important battles</h3>
                 
                <p> In 1394, Bayezid crossed the Danube River, leading a large army with him and attacking Wallachia, which at the time was led by Mircea the Elder. The Ottomans were four times larger than the Wallachians, but on October 10, 1394, in the Battle of Rovine, the Wallachians won, Bayezid's army was decimated, and  had to retreat across the Danube with the remnants of his army.<br>In 1391 he laid siege to Constantinople. At the request of the Byzantine emperor John the Palaeologus, a new crusade was organized to defeat Baiazid. In 1396, the Christian allies, under the leadership of the Hungarian king and the emperor of the Holy Roman Empire Sigismund, were defeated at the Battle of Nicopolis. To celebrate this victory, Bayezid built the "Great Mosque" (Ulu Camii) in Bursa.<br>The siege of Constantinople lasted until 1401. Even the emperor managed to escape the city, but the salvation of the Byzantine Empire came from the declaration of Mongol war against Baiazid.

             <div class="facilities-col">
                <h3> How he died</h3>
                <p> In 1400, the Mongol warrior Timur Lenk succeeded in persuading the local kingdoms, which had been conquered by the Turks, to join him in the attack on Baiazid. At the Battle of Ankara on July 20, 1402, Baiazid was captured by Timur. One year after his capture, Bayezid died: he reportedly committed suicide by breaking his head against the iron bars in his cage, while others claim to have taken poison from inside his ring.<br>
